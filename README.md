Wine Quality Prediction Using R
This project focuses on predicting wine quality based on its physicochemical properties, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, and residual sugar. The dataset for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains detailed information on these features, along with a quality score assigned by wine tasters. The main objective of this project is to identify patterns and relationships between these chemical attributes and the quality of wine, and to build machine learning models capable of accurately predicting wine quality.

The project begins with extensive data preprocessing, including cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and standardizing feature values to ensure uniform scaling. Following this, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase is conducted, where various visualizations such as histograms, heatmaps, and box plots are used to analyze distributions and correlations between variables. For example, heatmaps are used to identify strong correlations between features like alcohol content and wine quality, providing valuable insights for model building.

The core of this project is implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality. Several techniques are applied, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (C5.0), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks. Each model is trained and tested using cross-validation to ensure robust performance. A confusion matrix is used to evaluate model accuracy and identify any areas of improvement. The best-performing model, based on evaluation metrics, is highlighted as the optimal
